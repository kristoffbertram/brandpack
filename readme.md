# BrandPack
BrandPack is a simplified file browser, allowing the client to navigate and download brand assets. It features colour palette support (using coolors.co’s .scss files) and link support (using a .uri extension)
Practically it’s a single-file web application and can be dropped into any PHP supported web directory.

## Installing
 1. Upload the file to any PHP supported web directory. Having ImageMagick installed is a plus.
 2. Edit config.ini.
 3. Create and upload a folder and file structure containing all brand assets in the same folder you’ve installed BrandPack to.

 ## Using Palettes
 1. Create your palette at coolors.co
 2. Export the .scss file
 3. Upload to your server

 ## Using URI
 1. Create a text file with an URL
 2. Rename the text file to extension .uri
 3. Upload to your server

## History
I’ve been exclusively using BrandPack in my work as a brand designer. As an easy means of getting final brand assets to clients (and countering those ever returning “Can You Forward The Logo” requests, I designed and build this app as a easy-to-use and customisable portal. An earlier version of BrandPack actually came with more dependencies. Something that irked me as it would *pollute* the source directory, which lead me to build and release this drop-in.

## To Do (Immediate)
 - [ ] BrandPack is untested. This ranks pretty high up on the list.
 - [ ] Better responsiveness.
 - [ ] Implement “grouping”. Similarly named files (in a folder) can be offered grouped from the download panel.

## Disclaimer
 - This software very much fits my personal workflow. I don't intend for BrandPack to be an be-all and end-all solution but I do value its merits and imagine others mights too. Nonetheless, you may find this is app is not for you.
 - While I can find my way around most programming languages and achieve what I set out to do, I do not consider myself a programmer by any means. This may be somewhat reflected in my work. However, we exist to learn and I welcome all feedback.
